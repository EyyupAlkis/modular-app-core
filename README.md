## Modularization:
This repository is created to publish core implementations for a __Modular Android App__

```
- core
- core_presentation
- core_domain
- core_data
```

__Core module__ contains classes which can be used in every layer, such as injection annotations, injection scopes, error factories,
data holder models. _Core presentation,_ includes core module and classes which can be used in other features presentation modules
such as base ui classes, generic RecyclerView Adapter, ViewModel factories etc. __Core data__ includes core module and domain specific
interfaces such as Interactors. Core Data also includes core module, data source interfaces, default request interceptors and 
api module.
